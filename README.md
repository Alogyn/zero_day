# Vagrant: Exploring Local Development Environments

While sandboxes have their merits, there's an alternative approach to tackling your ALX assessmentsâ€”by harnessing the potential of your own local computer. This involves making use of a virtual machine (VM), an influential tool tailored for this purpose.

Let's take a closer look at the world of Vagrant today!
